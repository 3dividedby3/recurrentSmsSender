## Recurrent Sms Sender: Privacy policy

There 2 sensitive permissions(**make and manage phone calls** and **send and view sms messages**) requested by this application that can raise suspicions. They are needed in order for this application to do what it states it does: sending an configurabe SMS message to the specified phone number using the selected SIM card starting from the set date and recurring at the configured interval in minutes.

Even thou the permission requested is called make and manage phone calls this app will NOT make or manage phones calls, in fact this permission is needed to read the list of SIM cards(there is no finer permission available, unfortunatelly) that will be presented to the user so it can select which one to use when sending the SMS.

The other persmission, called send and view sms messages, is used ONLY to send sms messages, this app does NOT read any sms messages on your phone. Again, there is no finer permission available just for sending SMS messages.

None of the information, read as part of granting these permissions, will leave your phone. They are only read, used and forgotten as soon as they stop being usefull to the app.

Hope this app proves useful.
